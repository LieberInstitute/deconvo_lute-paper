This demo looks at the results of performing pseudobulking where the scale of the 
convoluted signals differs from that of the signature matrix (e.g. where Y consists 
of counts rather than mean ratios).

Note, we take $Y = \pi * Z$ as our representation of the deconvolution model.

# Assumptions

Suppose K = 4.

# Mathematical representation

$Y = \pi * Z$

$Y * F_{Y} = Y'$

So we have that

$Y' = Y * F_{Y} = \pi * Z * F_{Y}$

## The signature matrix $Z$

$Z' = R(L(C))$ where $R$ is the mean ratio function, $L$ is some log function, 
$C$ is counts.

or we might have

$Z' = Z' * F_{Z}$
