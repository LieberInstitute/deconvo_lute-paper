This shows progress with unit testing the functions to generate some series of signature
matrices ($Z$) from a `SummarizedExperiment` object.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Finding marker gene sets

# Making a single signature matrix

# Making matrix plots

# Making a signature matrix series

# Final matrix series runs, varying K and G
