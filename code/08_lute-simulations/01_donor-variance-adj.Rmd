Show simulation results of donor variance adjustments across low and high donor 
variances.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
libv <- c("lute", "ggpubr", "gridExtra")
sapply(libv, library, character.only = TRUE)
```

# Experiments

Using the `ComBat` method, vary donor variances using offsets of 5 and 100.

```{r}
lb <- donor_marker_biasexpt(offsetv = c(5, 100), donor.adj.method = "combat")
knitr::kable(lb$dfres, align = "c")
```
